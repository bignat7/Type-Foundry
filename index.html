        The environment is an education to those who are able to understand its language. We are influenced unconsciously by what surrounds us; but only by consciously perceiving what we see can we decipher its message and ultimately create our own message and world. 
        At present, because we can’t understand the language of cities, we leave their future to others: to the technical experts —city planners, architects, traffic and civil engineers, lawyers, and a host of specialists; to politicians and administrators, but mainly to the private real estate developers. The economic facts dictate that real estate development, like any other business, is done for profit. But what is profitable for the entrepreneur in a limited area is not necessarily what is needed by the whole city or all its inhabitants. In a democratic society building is too important a task to leave to the decisions of a few, no matter how well intentioned. It needs everyone’s interest, active participation, and concern. To participate constructively in city building, we must first of all understand what a city is and why men build cities: We must learn the visual language of cities because it is an expression of their functions over time and it records our values, society, and way of life. 
        Cities today fulfill many different functions. Some of these functions are in conflict with each other and create great hardship and strife: for example, expressways destroy housing, and beautiful parks can become danger spots. Some functions have continued through history, and others are constantly changing. At present we live once more in a time of fundamental urban change. Men come together to build cities in answer to their joint needs for community and communication, defense and protection, trade and exchange, worship and government, culture and learning. As Lewis Mumford says: “The city is the form and symbol of an integrated social relationship: It is the seat of the temple, the market, the hall of justice, the academy of learning.” 
        One of the basic and continuing functions of the city is its economic function, both as producer and market place. This function must be linked with transportation: Cities have been built at strategic spots for the exchange of goods: at harbors, river crossings, and trade route intersections. Others started as local or regional market centers for the surrounding countryside. Today the annual markets and trade fairs that are regularly scheduled in certain cities bring together people and business from all over the world. 
        Cities accelerated the division of labor and encouraged specialization. By now this specialization has increased so that certain cities are known for their concentration of special interests or products, for instance, Lausanne and Geneva for watches, the City of London, Zurich, and New York for banking, Paris for fashions, Salzburg for music and its festival, Manchester for textiles, and Detroit for automobiles. In the past the market city drew on its immediate surroundings. Now it often draws on a whole country or continent; the more specialized the product the larger the area from which the city draws. For large industries it is no longer profitable to produce for a limited area or small country. The European Common Market was created as one response to this fact. 
        By now electronic communication and air transport have transcended all natural and man-made barriers. These developments have also greatly changed the market functions of cities and their physical form. The locating of airports in relation to the city centers has become an important economic factor and also influences the location of new industry. Defense and protection are historic urban functions, which, however, by now are largely obsolete. In ancient times people built heavily fortified cities with storage space for food and provisions to hold out against the frequent raids of enemies and migrating tribes. Early Greek cities like Tiryns and Mycenae were heavily fortified; Sparta was entirely organized for war. The Roman camps created to defend the empire became the outposts of the Roman civilization and were the origin of many present-day European cities and towns, such as Vienna, on Marseilles, and Cologne. 
        Transportation has always determined the location of cities. Harbors are the reason for some of the greatest cities of the world, such as London, Rio de Janeiro, Singapore, Istanbul, and virtually all cities on the U. S. coasts. Rivers and trade route intersections created cities from antiquity until now, for instance, Paris, Vienna, Budapest, Prague, Chicago, St. Louis, and many others. But with the coming of air transportation, cities depend less on geography. Transportation, especially highway construction, today has become the most influential factor of urban development. While the city’s size from antiquity until the nineteenth century was limited by the distance man could comfortably walk, new means of transportation—trolleys, trains, subways and lately automobiles, buses and trucks—have enabled people to live in much larger, more spread-out cities. In turn, vertical transportation (elevators) and new construction methods and materials overcame the vertical limitations of building. While transportation has enabled many people to live outside the central cities, this has resulted in the growing tides of commuters that in turn have resulted in a wave of highway construction. Often highways and expressways have done serious damage to the social and physical fabric of cities, yet without good transportation a city can no longer exist. Education is a continuing function of the city. By its diversity of people, jobs, and ideas, the city not only acts as educator, but since antiquity it has been the seat of the academy and of scholarship. 
        Recently urban design has become once more a concern in replanning older cities or in the design for new communities. Yet too often the lasting cultural values of quality and beauty of the environment are abandoned in favor of temporary economic concerns. Housing throughout history has been the largest single function of the city; indeed, from a social and quantitative point of view it dominates the scene. In the past the aristocracy and the richest people always lived closest to the city centers and in the middle of the cities’ life. From antiquity to Renaissance Florence and to the eighteenth- century Central European baroque towns, the aristocracy and the most important families lived closest to the palace and the center of the tow</p>
